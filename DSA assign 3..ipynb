    "- P-values: They indicate the statistical significance of the coefficients. A p-value less than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) \n",
    "suggests that the coefficient is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Make predictions\n",
    "Once you have a satisfactory regression model, you can use it to make predictions for new values of advertising expenditure.\n",
    "Simply plug in the advertising expenditure values into the regression equation, and it will provide estimates for the corresponding sales values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is important to keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. While a regression analysis can reveal the relationship \n",
